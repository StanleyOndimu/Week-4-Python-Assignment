The file has a Person class with the following attributes:

    name: representing the person's name.
    age: representing the person's age.
    gender: representing the person's gender.
    
It also contains a method called <strong>introduce</strong> that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.

You can create an instance of the Person class and call the <strong>introduce</strong> method to display the person's information.
